# HueForge Models

This is a collection of [HueForge](https://shop.thehueforge.com/collections/hueforge) models created (with the Personal License).

Models contain:

* `*.png` - source image
* `*.hfp` - HueForge project file.
* `*.stl` - HueForge generated STL output
* `*.rar` - HueForge generated STL output that's compressed with [RAR4](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0) to avoid LFS.
* `*.txt` - HueForge generated STL description file with layer / filament transition hints.
* `*.3mf` - Slicer profile with configuration to slice model - usually created in [Orcaslicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer) or [Bambu Studio](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio).

Most models are printed on:

* [Bambu Labs P1S](https://bambulab.com/en-au/p1)
* [Bambu Labs X1C](https://bambulab.com/en-au/x1)

And uses the [Bambu Labs AMS](https://au.store.bambulab.com/products/ams-multicolor-printing) System. But this does not mean you need to as well. I'm just lazy :-)
